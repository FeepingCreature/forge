"""
TaskRunner — seam for "run work off the main thread."

Production code uses `QtTaskRunner`, which spawns a `QThread` per task
and marshals callbacks back via Qt's queued signals so they fire on the
caller's thread.

Tests use `SyncTaskRunner`, which runs the work function on the calling
thread and invokes callbacks immediately. With this swap, the entire
LiveSession pipeline (LLM call → inline commands → tools → next LLM
call) runs straight-line, no event loop required.

Design notes:
- `submit()` takes a work function that may need to emit progress events
  (chunks during streaming, per-tool started/finished). The work
  function receives an `Emitter` it can call to publish events. Events
  are routed to `on_event`. The function's return value is routed to
  `on_result`. Exceptions are caught and routed to `on_error`.
- Cancellation is cooperative. A `CancelToken` is also passed to the
  work function. When `handle.request_stop()` is called, the token's
  `.stop_requested` flag flips. Work that doesn't poll runs to
  completion, but its `on_result`/`on_event` callbacks become no-ops
  once the handle is cancelled — the result is silently dropped.
- We deliberately do *not* support hard termination. The previous
  `QThread.terminate()` path was unreliable and the source of more bugs
  than it ever fixed.
