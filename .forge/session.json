Used when diffs are redundant, old search results are stale, or consolidating operations.\\n\\n3. **delete_file.py** - Delete a file from VFS. The deletion is committed with other changes at end of turn.\\n\\n4. **get_lines.py** - Get lines surrounding a specific line number in a file. Useful for investigating errors that reference line numbers.\\n\\n5. **get_skill.py** - Get detailed documentation for specific complex/rarely-used tasks.
