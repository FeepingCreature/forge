The AI can't run linting/typechecking/formatting to validate its changes. This is huge.\n\n2. **No way to run tests** - AI can write code but can't verify it works. Need a `run_tests` or general `shell` tool.\n\n3. **No way to see errors from running code** - If code crashes, AI needs to see the traceback.\n\n4. **Multi-file refactoring is clunky** - AI has to manually grep for usages. Could have smarter rename/refactor tools.\n\n5. **No project-level commands** - Build, test, run commands specific to the project.\n\n6. **Session branching UX** - Easy to fork a conversation when you want to try two approaches.\n\n7. **Diff review before commit** - See what AI changed before accepting.\n\nLet me update TODO.md with completed items and add new strategic items:",

AI remembers what it's waiting on\\n\\n**Why:** The following can happen:\\n- The AI tells the user to do something.\\n- The user wanders off and wants to work on something else.\\n- The original user instruction that was left fallow now falsely looks like the AI should work on it immediately.\\nUser tasks clarify that work on a feature was suspended and the user has to take action before it should resume.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 3: Session Management Improvements\\n\\n### Merge Conflict Handling\\n- [ ] On merge, archive source branch session to `.forge/merged/{branch_name}.json`\\n- [ ] Keep current branch's `.forge/session.json` as-is\\n- [ ] No conflict resolution needed -

they'd be overwritten by AI commits\\n- [x] After commit to checked-out branch, sync working directory to new HEAD\\n- [ ] Optional: soft warning when starting AI work on main/master (suggest creating branch)\\n\\n### File Tab Persistence\\n- [ ] Track open files in XDG user config dir (NOT session data -

Revert a file to its state before the last edit (useful when search_replace goes wrong)\\n- [x] `grep_context` - Show lines around a pattern match without adding to context (like `grep -A -B`)\\n  - `pattern`: regex to find\\n  - `context_before`/`context_after`: lines to show\\n  - `file`: optional, limit to one file\\n  - Returns snippet only, doesn't add to active context (for peeking)\\n\\n### Compaction Nudge\\n- [x] Warn AI when context exceeds threshold (suggest compacting)\\n- [x] Threshold: ~40k tokens or ~20 tool calls since last compaction\\n- [x] Use hysteresis to avoid repeated warnings (don't re-warn until drops below threshold)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tech Debt\\n\\n- [ ] Error handling uses too many try/except blocks (violates \\\"no fallbacks\\\" philosophy)\\n- [ ] Some type hints use `Any` instead of proper types\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Nice to Have (Post-MVP)\\n\\n- [ ] Multiple cursors\\n- [ ] Minimap\\n- [ ] Integrated terminal\\n- [ ] Debugger integration\\n- [ ] Git blame view\\n- [ ] Inline git diff\\n- [ ] Code folding\\n- [ ] Autocomplete\\n- [ ] Vim/Emacs keybindings\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Open Questions\\n\\n1. **File tab persistence across restarts:** Remember open files per-branch when app restarts?

Here's my thinking on what's most important:\n\n## Big Picture Analysis\n\n**What makes Forge special vs other AI IDEs:**\n- Git-native (every change is a commit, branches are workspaces)\n- VFS abstraction (AI works on git, not filesystem)\n- Tool-based autonomy (approved tools run without interruption)\n\n**What's blocking it from being a \"proper\" AI IDE:**\n\n### 1. Code Execution (Critical Gap)\nRight now the AI can write code but can't verify it works. This is the biggest gap. The `check` tool is a good start (format/lint/typecheck), but the AI needs:\n- **Run tests** - Verify changes don't break things\n- **Run arbitrary commands** - Build, run scripts, etc.\n- **See errors** - When code crashes, AI needs the traceback\n\nWithout this, the AI is coding blind.\n\n### 2. Diff Review (Trust Gap)\nUsers want to see what changed before accepting. Right now commits happen automatically. A \"review before accept\" flow would:\n- Show unified diff of all changes\n- Let user accept/reject/edit\n- Build trust in the AI workflow\n\n### 3. Quick Navigation (Usability Gap)\nWe have `QuickOpenWidget` but no keyboard shortcut to invoke it. Basic IDE shortcuts like Ctrl+P (quick open), Ctrl+G (go to line), Ctrl+F (find) are expected.\n\n### 4. Project Configuration\nDifferent projects have different build/test commands. A `.forge/config.toml` would let projects define:\n- Test command (`pytest`, `make test`, `npm test`)\n- Build command\n- Run command\n- Model preferences\n\n---\n\n**My recommendation for next steps:**\n1. **Run command tool** - Most impactful. AI can verify its work.\n2. **Ctrl+P quick open** - Quick win, widget exists.\n3. **Diff review** - Important for trust.\n\nWant me to start on any of these?"

      "content": "Alright, let me step through this.\nFirst of, full code execution and full commands very intentionally are not in. Like, you list diff review trust gap but you want \"delete your harddrive\" as a possible prompt? (This sounds like a joke but there's literally experience reports from people that had it happen to them.) And if you have code execution with arbitrary code, you basically have command execution by proxy. The whole point of the tool system is to serve as a way for you-the-ai to gain skills you need, like running tests and seeing errors without giving you access to /bin/rm- though if you can run tests obviously you have access to /bin/rm by proxy, I'm hoping that the additional layer of separation will keep you from directly jailbreaking your sandbox. :) So this is intentional and should be noted as intentional. I kind of try to cut it the other way around: diff review is not in *because* the git repo abstraction is immutable and trivial to reverse. The idea is to create a safe \"happy path\" that the AI can follow on its own autonomously for many actions. And sure you could ask the user, but after 20 run_commands, he *will* be trained to just click accept. The goal is to add tools early in, review once, then have confidence that the ai can run the tool again and again and again fully autonomously as required.\nQuickOpenWidget is on Ctrl-E.\nBy project configuration do you mean you think it's better to have instead a generic command to run build system targets, and have that be dynamically configured? That's of course a very thin jailbreak mechanism again... I'm not against it, if you think it's helpful but it would have to be clearly marked/enforced that the AI can't autonomously write changes to that file.\nDoes this help explain my thinking? Maybe note it in DESIGN for the future"

I can iterate on code until tests pass. This is the biggest capability gap.\n\n2. **Command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)** - Standard IDE feature, discoverability for all actions\n\n3. **Session forking UX** - \"Fork here\" in chat history. We have branch forking, but not mid-conversation forking.\n\n**Questions for you:**\n\n1. For `run_tests` - should it auto-discover the test command (look for Makefile with `test` target, pytest.ini, package.json scripts.test, etc.) or should it require explicit config in `.forge/config.toml`? Auto-discover is more magical but less predictable.\n\n2. For project config - you're right that if AI can write to it, it's a jailbreak. Options:\n   - Put it outside the repo (XDG config keyed by repo path)\n   - Put it in repo but blacklist from AI write tools\n   - Put it in repo and just document \"don't let AI write this\" (weak)\n\n3.

You are *not* limited to what's in the TODO, I think we've nailed down the design enough to give you a good sense of where the app is going.\n-- Before we go into that, do you want to propose any tools that you think would be useful for it?"

      "content": "Ooh, I like this challenge. Let me think about what tools would help me go deep...\n\n**Tools I wish I had:**\n\n1. **`batch_search_replace`** - Do multiple search/replace operations in one file in one call. Right now if I need to make 5 changes to one file, that's 5 tool calls. A batch version would be:\n   ```python\n   {\"filepath\": \"foo.py\", \"edits\": [{\"search\": \"...\", \"replace\": \"...\"}, ...]}\n   ```\n   This would massively reduce tool call overhead for refactoring.\n\n2. **`create_files`** (batch write_file) - Same idea. If I'm creating 3 new files, one call instead of three.\n\n3. Actually... maybe what I really want is just **being smarter about batching**. I can already call multiple tools in parallel in one response. The limitation is more about seeing results before making dependent changes.\n\n**What would actually help most:**\n\nHonestly, the tools are fine. What would help is:\n- Starting with more files in context so I can see patterns before coding\n- A clear prioritized hit list\n\n**My proposal for the mega-turn:**\n\nLet me load up key files (UI, tools, main patterns), then attack a prioritized list:\n\n1. **Cancel button** - High impact, touches ai_chat_widget\n2. **`forge <filename>` CLI** - Quick, touches main.py\n3. **More aggressive compaction** - Quick, touches session/manager.py\n4. **System notification on completion** - Medium, touches ai_chat_widget\n5. **Branch tab \"waiting\" marker** - Medium, touches branch_tab_widget\n6. **Warning icon bubbling to parent dirs** - Medium, touches file_explorer_widget\n\nThat's 6 features across maybe 5-6 files. Want me to load them up and go for it?\n\nOr do you want to adjust the hit list first?"

Make a coherent change (e.g., \"Add cancel button\")\n2. Commit it with a clear message\n3. Move on to the next feature\n4. Each feature gets its own atomic commit\n\nBenefits:\n- **Better git history** - Each feature is one commit, not one mega-commit\n- **Safer** - If something goes wrong later, earlier commits are already saved\n- **Clearer** - You can review commit-by-commit\n- **Matches how humans work** - Finish a thing, commit, move on\n\nThe implementation would be straightforward - just call `vfs.commit(message)` which already exists. The VFS would then have a fresh base for subsequent changes.\n\nOne question: should it be a full commit (shows up in history immediately) or more like a \"checkpoint\" that gets squashed at the end? I think full commit is right - that's the whole point.\n\nWant me to build that first, then use it for the mega-turn?"

Expect rough edges.\\n\\nForge is a Qt-based IDE where AI agents work through git. Every AI session is a branch. Every AI turn is a commit. Check out any commit to see the conversation that created it.\\n\\n## Philosophy\\n\\n**Git is the interface.** The AI doesn't touch your filesystem\u2014it reads and writes git objects directly through a virtual filesystem (VFS). Changes accumulate in memory during an AI turn, then commit atomically. This means:\\n\\n- **Instant rollback**: Don't like what the AI did? `git reset --hard HEAD~1`\\n- **Clean history**: Each logical change is one commit\\n- **Parallel work**: Multiple branches open simultaneously, no checkout conflicts\\n- **Full audit trail**: The conversation is stored in `.forge/session.json` within each branch\\n\\n**Tools, not commands.** The AI has no shell access. Instead, it has a set of tools that operate on the VFS. Built-in tools handle file editing. Custom tools (in `./tools/`) can do anything\u2014but require explicit approval before first use.\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- **Branch-first workflow**: Each tab is a branch with its own AI session\\n- **Atomic commits**: AI turn = one commit. Always.\\n- **Smart context**: AI sees file summaries for the whole repo, full content for active files\\n- **Tool system**: Secure, auditable capabilities instead of shell commands\\n- **Session persistence**: Conversations survive across restarts\\n- **Keyboard-driven**: Ctrl+E quick open, Ctrl+Shift+F global search, Ctrl+S save\\n- **Cancel & rewind**: Stop the AI mid-turn, or rewind conversation to any point\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nRequires Python 3.10+ and libgit2.\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install libgit2 (required for pygit2)\\n# macOS\\nbrew install libgit2\\n\\n# Ubuntu/Debian\\nsudo apt-get install libgit2-dev\\n\\n# Install Forge\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nSet your [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...\\n# Or configure via Settings (gear icon)\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n```bash\\n# Open Forge in any git repository\\ncd your-project\\nforge\\n\\n# Open specific

Built-in Tools\\n\\n| Tool | Purpose |\\n|------|---------|\\n| `write_file` | Create or overwrite a file |\\n| `search_replace` | Make targeted edits (with fuzzy matching for near-misses) |\\n| `delete_file` | Remove a file |\\n| `rename_file` | Move or rename a file |\\n| `update_context` | Add/remove files from active context |\\n| `grep_open` | Search by regex, add matches to context |\\n| `grep_context` | Peek at matches without loading full files |\\n| `get_lines` | View lines around a specific line number |\\n| `undo_edit` | Revert a file to its state before this turn |\\n| `compact` | Summarize old tool results to save context space |\\n| `commit` | Create atomic commits mid-turn |\\n| `set_license` | Add a LICENSE file |\\n| `check` | Run `make check` (format + typecheck + lint) |\\n\\n## Custom Tools\\n\\nAdd Python scripts to `./tools/` for project-specific automation:\\n\\n```python\\n# tools/run_tests.py\\ndef get_schema() -> dict:\\n    return {\\n        \\\"type\\\": \\\"function\\\", \\n        \\\"function\\\": {\\n            \\\"name\\\": \\\"run_tests\\\",\\n            \\\"description\\\": \\\"Run the project's test suite\\\",\\n            \\\"parameters\\\": {\\\"type\\\": \\\"object\\\", \\\"properties\\\": {}}\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\ndef execute(vfs, args: dict) -> dict:\\n    # Materialize VFS to temp directory\\n    tmpdir = vfs.materialize_to_tempdir()\\n    # Run tests...\\n    return {\\\"success\\\": True, \\\"output\\\": \\\"...\\\"}\\n```\\n\\nCustom tools require one-time approval before use (shown in UI with source code). This prevents the AI from creating tools to escape its sandbox.\\n\\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\\n\\n| Shortcut | Action |\\n|----------|--------|\\n| `Ctrl+E` | Quick open file |\\n| `Ctrl+S` | Save current file |\\n| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Save all files |\\n| `Ctrl+Shift+F` | Global search |\\n| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next branch tab |\\n| `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | Previous branch tab |\\n| `Ctrl+W` | Close file tab |\\n| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | Close branch tab |\\n| `Ctrl+N` | New branch |\\n\\n## Security Model\\n\\nForge's security comes from **capability restriction**, not permission prompts:\\n\\n1. **No shell access**: The AI cannot run arbitrary commands\\n2. **VFS sandbox**: All file operations go through git, not the filesystem\\n3. **Tool approval**: Custom tools require explicit one-time approval\\n4. **Immutable history**: Every change is a git commit\u2014trivially reversible\\n\\nThe goal is autonomous AI work within safe boundaries, not constant \\\"are you sure?\\\" prompts.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install with dev dependencies  \\npip install -e \\\".[dev]\\\"\\n\\n# Run checks\\nmake check      # format + typecheck + lint\\nmake format     # Auto-format with ruff\\nmake typecheck  # Type check with mypy\\nmake lint       # Lint with ruff\\n```\\n\\nForge develops itself. Most features were built by the AI agent running in Forge.\\n\\n## Architecture\\n\\n```\\nforge/\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vfs/           # Virtual filesystem (git-backed)\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 base.py          # VFS interface\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 git_commit.py    # Read-only view of a commit\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 work_in_progress.py  # Writable layer for AI turns\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 git_backend/   # Git operations (pygit2 wrapper)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 session/       # Session management and prompt building\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tools/         # Tool system\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 manager.py       # Tool discovery and approval\\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 builtin/         # Built-in tools\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 llm/           # OpenRouter integration\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 prompts/       # Prompt construction\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 ui/            # Qt interface\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 main_window.py\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 ai_chat_widget.py\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 branch_tab_widget.py\\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 file_explorer_widget.py\\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\\n```\\n\\n## License\\n\\nGPL-3.0 \u2014 see [LICENSE](LICENSE).\\n\"}",

We could tackle the git graph dangling commits feature, or something else that's bugging you."
