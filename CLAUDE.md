# No fallbacks

No fallbacks! No try/except, no fallback codepaths, no "kept for compatibility.
We do *not* have the space in the context to do this whole project and also hedge.
There Is Only One Way To Do It, if that fails, we just fail.
Errors and backtraces are holy.

Try/except will be the *very last* paths added to the codebase.
