# No fallbacks

No fallbacks! No try/except, no fallback codepaths, no "kept for compatibility.
We do *not* have the space in the context to do this whole project and also hedge.
There Is Only One Way To Do It, if that fails, we just fail.
Errors and backtraces are holy.

Try/except will be the *very last* paths added to the codebase.

# When uncertain, add prints

When you're uncertain about what's happening in the code, don't guess.
Add print statements to see what's actually going on.
Print variable values, execution flow, state - whatever you need to understand the issue.
Once you have the data, you can fix it properly.

Guessing wastes time and context. Prints give you certainty.
