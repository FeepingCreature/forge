We can worry about limiting this later.\n- Assign a fixed position to every commit first. I'm not 100% sure what the logic is and the order in which we need to go, especially considering we can have multiple roots. The y axis should be in some way equivalent to time. I'm thinking something like... two commits in branch A and B can be side by side, but if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row. I'm not sure if this makes sense or can be formalized. I think there's a formalization *possible* here but I'm not sure about what it looks like. You know what, let's put everything else aside and work on formalizing a sensible way to order commits so as to not waste vertical space but also indicate some property related to commit time? Feel free to use GRAPH_COMMIT_ORDERING.md as a scratchpad for this. Over to you."

Because:\\n- Parent must always be below child (topological constraint)\\n- When two commits have no ancestor relationship, use time to decide relative position\\n\\n## The Algorithm\\n\\n### Step 1: Topological Sort with Time\\n\\nAssign each commit a \\\"row\\\" based on:\\n1. All parents must have higher row numbers (further down)\\n2. Among commits that could go in the same position, order by time\\n\\nThis is essentially: **reverse topological sort, stable-sorted by commit time**\\n\\n### Step 2: Assign Columns (X positions)\\n\\nThis is about tracking \\\"lanes\\\" for different lines of development:\\n- When a branch starts (commit has no children in our view), it needs a column\\n- When branches merge, we can potentially free up a column\\n- We want to minimize crossings and keep related commits together\\n\\n### Formalization\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- `row(c)` = y-position of commit c\\n- `time(c)` = commit timestamp\\n- `parents(c)` = set of parent commits\\n\\n**Constraint 1 (Topological)**: For all commits c and all p in parents(c):\\n```\\nrow(c) < row(p)\\n```\\n\\n**Constraint 2 (Time Consistency)**: For commits a, b with no ancestor relationship:\\n```\\nif time(a) > time(b) then row(a) \u2264 row(b)\\n```\\n\\n**Objective**: Minimize total rows used (or equivalently, minimize gaps)\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```\\nTime    Commits\\n----    -------\\nT5      A (branch-x)\\nT4      B (branch-y)  \\nT3      C (branch-x, parent of A)\\nT2      D (branch-y, parent of B)\\nT1      E (merge base, parent of C and D)\\n```\\n\\nNaive approach (pure time ordering):\\n```\\nRow 0: A\\nRow 1: B\\nRow 2: C\\nRow 3: D\\nRow 4: E\\n```\\n\\nBut this wastes space! A and B can share a row since they're independent:\\n\\n```\\nRow 0: A   B\\nRow 1: C   D\\nRow 2:   E\\n```\\n\\n### The Compaction Algorithm\\n\\n1. **Compute topological depth**: For each commit, its minimum possible row is `1 + max(depth of children)` (or 0 if no children)\\n\\n2. **Process commits in time order** (newest first):\\n   - Assign to the earliest row that satisfies:\\n     a. Row \u2265 topological minimum\\n     b. Column is available at that row\\n     c. Column assignment is consistent with parent/child relationships\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. The issue is that we're conflating two different things:\\n- Row assignment (y-position)\\n- Column assignment (x-position)\\n\\nLet me separate these clearly.\\n\\n## Revised Approach\\n\\n### Phase 1: Row Assignment\\n\\n**Goal**: Assign each commit a row such that:\\n1. Parents are always in higher-numbered rows than children\\n2. We use as few rows as possible\\n3. Time ordering is respected where possible\\n\\n**Algorithm**:\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_rows(commits):\\n    # Sort by time, newest first\\n    sorted_commits = sorted(commits, key=lambda c: -c.time)\\n    \\n    # For each commit, track the minimum row it can be in\\n    # (must be > all children's rows)\\n    min_row = {}\\n    row = {}\\n    \\n    for commit in sorted_commits:\\n        # Find minimum row based on children\\n        children = get_children(commit)\\n        if children:\\n            min_possible = max(row[child] for child in children) + 1\\n        else:\\n            min_possible = 0\\n        \\n        min_row[commit] = min_possible\\n        row[commit] = min_possible  # Greedy: use minimum possible\\n    \\n    return row\\n```\\n\\nWait, this doesn't work because we process newest first, so we don't know children's rows yet.\\n\\nLet me flip it:\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_rows(commits):\\n    # Sort by time, oldest first\\n    sorted_commits = sorted(commits, key=lambda c: c.time)\\n    \\n    row = {}\\n    max_row = -1\\n    \\n    # Process oldest first, assign from bottom up\\n    for commit in sorted_commits:\\n        parents = commit.parents\\n        if parents:\\n            # Must be above all parents\\n            min_possible = max(row[parent] for parent in parents if parent in row) + 1\\n        else:\\n            # Root commit - can go at row 0\\n            min_possible = 0\\n        \\n        # But we want to go as low as possible to save space\\n        # Actually, if we're going oldest-first, we're building bottom-up\\n        # The constraint is: must be above parents\\n        # So min_possible is correct\\n        \\n        row[commit] = min_possible\\n        max_row = max(max_row, min_possible)\\n    \\n    return row\\n```\\n\\nHmm, but this might create gaps. Let me think with an example:\\n\\n```\\nCommits (oldest to newest): E, D, C, B, A\\nParents: A\u2192C, B\u2192D, C\u2192E, D\u2192E\\n\\nProcessing order: E, D, C, B, A\\n- E: no parents, row = 0\\n- D: parent E at row 0, so row = 1\\n- C: parent E at row 0, so row = 1  (same as D!)\\n- B: parent D at row 1, so row = 2\\n- A: parent C at row 1, so row = 2  (same as B!)\\n\\nResult:\\nRow 2: A  B\\nRow 1: C  D\\nRow 0:   E\\n```\\n\\nThis naturally compacts! The key insight is that processing in time order (oldest first) and always taking the minimum valid row achieves the compaction automatically.\\n\\n### Phase 2: Column Assignment\\n\\nNow we need to assign x-positions. This is about:\\n1. Keeping the same \\\"branch\\\" in the same column where possible\\n2. Minimizing edge crossings\\n3. Handling merges and forks\\n\\n**Simple approach**: Track \\\"active lanes\\\"\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_columns(commits, rows):\\n    # Group commits by row\\n    by_row = defaultdict(list)\\n    for c in commits:\\n        by_row[rows[c]].append(c)\\n    \\n    column = {}\\n    next_free_column = 0\\n    commit_to_lane = {}  # Track which lane a commit's line of development is in\\n    \\n    # Process from bottom (oldest) to top (newest)\\n    for row in sorted(by_row.keys()):\\n        commits_in_row = by_row[row]\\n        \\n        for commit in commits_in_row:\\n            # If this commit has a parent whose lane is free, use it\\n            # Otherwise, allocate a new lane\\n            \\n            parent_lanes = [commit_to_lane[p] for p in commit.parents if p in commit_to_lane]\\n            \\n            if parent_lanes:\\n                # Prefer to continue in parent's lane\\n                # If multiple parents (merge), pick one and the others will have edges\\n                chosen_lane = parent_lanes[0]  # Could be smarter here\\n            else:\\n                chosen_lane = next_free_column\\n                next_free_column += 1\\n            \\n            column[commit] = chosen_lane\\n            commit_to_lane[commit] = chosen_lane\\n    \\n    return column\\n```\\n\\nThis is a simplification - real implementations get more sophisticated about lane reuse and minimizing crossings.\\n\\n## Final Algorithm Summary\\n\\n1. **Collect all commits** from the repository\\n2. **Topological sort by time** (oldest first)\\n3. **Assign rows** (y-positions) greedily - each commit gets `max(parent_rows) + 1`\\n4. **Assign columns** (x-positions) by tracking active lanes\\n\\n## Edge Cases\\n\\n### Multiple Roots\\nSome repos have multiple root commits (orphan branches, or multiple initial commits). These are handled naturally - each root gets row 0, and they'll be in different columns.\\n\\n### Octopus Merges\\nA commit with multiple parents - the row must be above ALL parents, so it's `max(all_parent_rows) + 1`.\\n\\n### Very Wide Graphs\\nIf there are many parallel branches, we get many columns. May need horizontal scrolling or collapsing inactive branches.\\n\\n## Implementation Notes\\n\\nFor the actual UI:\\n- Each row has a fixed height\\n- Each column has a fixed width\\n- Draw commits as dots/circles\\n- Draw edges (parent relationships) as lines, potentially with curves for crossings\\n- Color-code by branch if possible\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\\n\"}",

A is newer than B, but row(A) > row(B). This violates time consistency!\\n\\n**But wait** - is this actually a problem? Let me re-examine what we want.\\n\\n## Re-examining the Requirements\\n\\nThe original requirement was:\\n> \\\"Two commits in branch A and B can be side by side, but if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row.\\\"\\n\\nLet me parse this more carefully. I think the intuition is:\\n\\n**Reading the graph top-to-bottom should feel roughly like reading time backwards** (newest to oldest). But we don't want to be *strict* about it because that wastes space.\\n\\nThe question is: when MUST we enforce time ordering, and when can we relax it?\\n\\n### Proposal: Time Ordering Within Ancestor Chains Only\\n\\nMaybe the rule should be:\\n- Within a single line of development (ancestor chain), time must be respected\\n- Between unrelated commits, we allow flexibility\\n\\nBut ancestor chains already respect time by the topological constraint! Parents are always older than children, and they're always in higher-numbered rows.\\n\\nSo actually, **the current algorithm is fine**. The \\\"time consistency\\\" constraint I wrote earlier is too strict.\\n\\n### What About Parallel Branches?\\n\\nThe concern might be visual: if branch A and branch B are side by side, and you're scanning down, you expect to be going back in time. But if commits jump around in time between columns, it's confusing.\\n\\nLet me think about this differently. Consider:\\n\\n```\\n     col0  col1\\nrow0:  A    B\\nrow1:  C    D  \\nrow2:     E\\n```\\n\\nWhere times are: A=T5, B=T4, C=T3, D=T2, E=T1\\n\\nReading column 0: A(T5) \u2192 C(T3) - going back in time \u2713\\nReading column 1: B(T4) \u2192 D(T2) \u2192 E(T1) - going back in time \u2713\\nReading row 0: A(T5), B(T4) - both recent\\nReading row 1: C(T3), D(T2) - both older\\n\\nThis feels right! The rows are roughly \\\"eras\\\" even if not strictly time-ordered.\\n\\n### The Actual Invariant\\n\\nI think what we want is:\\n\\n**Invariant**: Within a row, commits should be \\\"roughly contemporary\\\". More precisely, no commit in row N should be an ancestor of a commit in row M where M > N.\\n\\nThis is exactly the topological constraint, which our algorithm satisfies!\\n\\n## Refined Understanding\\n\\nThe algorithm is:\\n1. Process commits oldest-first\\n2. Each commit goes in row = `max(parent_rows) + 1` (or 0 if root)\\n3. This automatically achieves compaction while maintaining topological order\\n\\nThe \\\"time\\\" aspect is a soft property:\\n- Commits in higher rows (lower numbers) tend to be newer\\n- But there's no strict guarantee between unrelated commits\\n- That's okay! The visual makes sense because each column reads like a timeline\\n\\n## What About the Original Example?\\n\\n> \\\"if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row\\\"\\n\\n```\\nBranch A: A1 (T5), A2 (T3), A3 (T1)  [A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 A3]\\nBranch B: B1 (T4), B2 (T2)           [B1 \u2192 B2]\\nCommon ancestor: ROOT\\n\\nLet's say A3 and B2 both have ROOT as parent.\\n```\\n\\nProcessing order by time: ROOT, A3, B2, A2, B1, A1\\n\\n- ROOT: row 0\\n- A3 (T1): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n- B2 (T2): parent ROOT, row = 1  \\n- A2 (T3): parent A3, row = 2\\n- B1 (T4): parent B2, row = 2\\n- A1 (T5): parent A2, row = 3\\n\\nResult:\\n```\\nrow3: A1\\nrow2: A2  B1\\nrow1: A3  B2\\nrow0:  ROOT\\n```\\n\\nHmm, but A2 (T3) and B1 (T4) are in the same row, even though A2 is older. Is this bad?\\n\\nI don't think so - they're at the same \\\"depth\\\" from their common ancestor. The visual still makes sense: both are \\\"one step up\\\" from their respective parents.\\n\\nBut wait, the original requirement said \\\"B has to skip a row\\\" in some case. Let me re-read...\\n\\n> \\\"if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row\\\"\\n\\nI think this is saying: if you have:\\n- Branch A at row N with commits A1, A2 where A2 is the parent\\n- Branch B at row N with commit B1\\n- And A1 and A2 are BOTH older than B1\\n\\nThen B1 should be at a higher row (lower number) than A2.\\n\\nLet me construct this:\\n```\\nBranch A: A1 (T2) \u2192 A2 (T1)\\nBranch B: B1 (T4)\\nAll rooted at ROOT (T0)\\n```\\n\\nWait, that can't be right. If A1 \u2192 A2, then A1 is the child and A2 is the parent. So A1 is newer than A2 (typically). Let me use clearer names:\\n\\n```\\nBranch A: A_head (T2) \u2192 A_middle (T1) \u2192 ROOT (T0)\\nBranch B: B_head (T4) \u2192 ROOT (T0)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: ROOT, A_middle, A_head, B_head\\n\\n- ROOT: row 0\\n- A_middle (T1): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n- A_head (T2): parent A_middle, row = 2\\n- B_head (T4): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n\\nResult:\\n```\\nrow2: A_head\\nrow1: A_middle  B_head\\nrow0:    ROOT\\n```\\n\\nHere B_head (T4) is at row 1, same as A_middle (T1), even though B_head is much newer.\\n\\nIs this what the requirement was concerned about? Should B_head be at row 2 instead?\\n\\nThe argument for row 2: \\\"B_head is newer than A_head, so it should be at least as high\\\"\\nThe argument for row 1: \\\"B_head is only one commit from ROOT, so depth-wise it's at level 1\\\"\\n\\nI think **the depth-based approach is correct**. The alternative (strict time ordering) would create gaps:\\n\\n```\\nrow3: \\nrow2: A_head  B_head   <- B_head here due to time, but wastes row3\\nrow1: A_middle\\nrow0:    ROOT\\n```\\n\\nThis wastes vertical space without adding clarity.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe algorithm I proposed is correct:\\n1. Process oldest-first\\n2. Row = max(parent rows) + 1\\n3. This gives topological order with good compaction\\n4. Time is a soft property (tends to increase going up, but not strictly)\\n\\nThe original intuition about \\\"skipping rows\\\" was probably about a different case, or was an over-specification. The depth-based approach produces sensible, compact graphs.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

Each commit's row = `max(parent_rows) + 1` (or 0 if root)\n3. Columns are assigned by tracking \"lanes\" - continue parent's lane if possible, otherwise allocate new\n\n**Key insight:** The y-axis isn't strictly \"time\" - it's **topological depth**. Time is only used for processing order (which affects tie-breaking when multiple commits could go in the same row).\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Parents are always below children (topological constraint satisfied)\n- Parallel branches naturally compact - if two commits have the same depth from their common ancestor, they share a row\n- Each column still reads as a timeline (going down = going back in time within that branch)\n- Rows are roughly \"eras\" but not strictly time-ordered across columns\n\n**The original concern about \"skipping rows\"** was over-specified. Consider:\n```\nBranch A: A_head (T2) \u2192 A_middle (T1) \u2192 ROOT\nBranch B: B_head (T4) \u2192 ROOT\n```\n\nResult:\n```\nrow2: A_head\nrow1: A_middle  B_head\nrow0:    ROOT\n```\n\nB_head is newer than A_head but at a lower row. This is **correct** - B_head is only 1 commit from ROOT, while A_head is 2 commits away. Forcing B_head to row 2 would waste space and not add clarity.\n\n**The invariant we actually want:** No commit in row N is an ancestor of any commit in row M where M > N. This is exactly what topological ordering gives us.\n\nWant me to proceed with implementing this, or do you want to discuss the approach further?"
