We can worry about limiting this later.\n- Assign a fixed position to every commit first. I'm not 100% sure what the logic is and the order in which we need to go, especially considering we can have multiple roots. The y axis should be in some way equivalent to time. I'm thinking something like... two commits in branch A and B can be side by side, but if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row. I'm not sure if this makes sense or can be formalized. I think there's a formalization *possible* here but I'm not sure about what it looks like. You know what, let's put everything else aside and work on formalizing a sensible way to order commits so as to not waste vertical space but also indicate some property related to commit time?

Because:\\n- Parent must always be below child (topological constraint)\\n- When two commits have no ancestor relationship, use time to decide relative position\\n\\n## The Algorithm\\n\\n### Step 1: Topological Sort with Time\\n\\nAssign each commit a \\\"row\\\" based on:\\n1. All parents must have higher row numbers (further down)\\n2. Among commits that could go in the same position, order by time\\n\\nThis is essentially: **reverse topological sort, stable-sorted by commit time**\\n\\n### Step 2: Assign Columns (X positions)\\n\\nThis is about tracking \\\"lanes\\\" for different lines of development:\\n- When a branch starts (commit has no children in our view), it needs a column\\n- When branches merge, we can potentially free up a column\\n- We want to minimize crossings and keep related commits together\\n\\n### Formalization\\n\\nLet's define:\\n- `row(c)` = y-position of commit c\\n- `time(c)` = commit timestamp\\n- `parents(c)` = set of parent commits\\n\\n**Constraint 1 (Topological)**: For all commits c and all p in parents(c):\\n```\\nrow(c) < row(p)\\n```\\n\\n**Constraint 2 (Time Consistency)**: For commits a, b with no ancestor relationship:\\n```\\nif time(a) > time(b) then row(a) \u2264 row(b)\\n```\\n\\n**Objective**: Minimize total rows used (or equivalently, minimize gaps)\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```\\nTime    Commits\\n----    -------\\nT5      A (branch-x)\\nT4      B (branch-y)  \\nT3      C (branch-x, parent of A)\\nT2      D (branch-y, parent of B)\\nT1      E (merge base, parent of C and D)\\n```\\n\\nNaive approach (pure time ordering):\\n```\\nRow 0: A\\nRow 1: B\\nRow 2: C\\nRow 3: D\\nRow 4: E\\n```\\n\\nBut this wastes space! A and B can share a row since they're independent:\\n\\n```\\nRow 0: A   B\\nRow 1: C   D\\nRow 2:   E\\n```\\n\\n### The Compaction Algorithm\\n\\n1. **Compute topological depth**: For each commit, its minimum possible row is `1 + max(depth of children)` (or 0 if no children)\\n\\n2. **Process commits in time order** (newest first):\\n   - Assign to the earliest row that satisfies:\\n     a. Row \u2265 topological minimum\\n     b. Column is available at that row\\n     c. Column assignment is consistent with parent/child relationships\\n\\nWait, let me reconsider. The issue is that we're conflating two different things:\\n- Row assignment (y-position)\\n- Column assignment (x-position)\\n\\nLet me separate these clearly.\\n\\n## Revised Approach\\n\\n### Phase 1: Row Assignment\\n\\n**Goal**: Assign each commit a row such that:\\n1. Parents are always in higher-numbered rows than children\\n2. We use as few rows as possible\\n3. Time ordering is respected where possible\\n\\n**Algorithm**:\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_rows(commits):\\n    # Sort by time, newest first\\n    sorted_commits = sorted(commits, key=lambda c: -c.time)\\n    \\n    # For each commit, track the minimum row it can be in\\n    # (must be > all children's rows)\\n    min_row = {}\\n    row = {}\\n    \\n    for commit in sorted_commits:\\n        # Find minimum row based on children\\n        children = get_children(commit)\\n        if children:\\n            min_possible = max(row[child] for child in children) + 1\\n        else:\\n            min_possible = 0\\n        \\n        min_row[commit] = min_possible\\n        row[commit] = min_possible  # Greedy: use minimum possible\\n    \\n    return row\\n```\\n\\nWait, this doesn't work because we process newest first, so we don't know children's rows yet.\\n\\nLet me flip it:\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_rows(commits):\\n    # Sort by time, oldest first\\n    sorted_commits = sorted(commits, key=lambda c: c.time)\\n    \\n    row = {}\\n    max_row = -1\\n    \\n    # Process oldest first, assign from bottom up\\n    for commit in sorted_commits:\\n        parents = commit.parents\\n        if parents:\\n            # Must be above all parents\\n            min_possible = max(row[parent] for parent in parents if parent in row) + 1\\n        else:\\n            # Root commit - can go at row 0\\n            min_possible = 0\\n        \\n        # But we want to go as low as possible to save space\\n        # Actually, if we're going oldest-first, we're building bottom-up\\n        # The constraint is: must be above parents\\n        # So min_possible is correct\\n        \\n        row[commit] = min_possible\\n        max_row = max(max_row, min_possible)\\n    \\n    return row\\n```\\n\\nHmm, but this might create gaps. Let me think with an example:\\n\\n```\\nCommits (oldest to newest): E, D, C, B, A\\nParents: A\u2192C, B\u2192D, C\u2192E, D\u2192E\\n\\nProcessing order: E, D, C, B, A\\n- E: no parents, row = 0\\n- D: parent E at row 0, so row = 1\\n- C: parent E at row 0, so row = 1  (same as D!)\\n- B: parent D at row 1, so row = 2\\n- A: parent C at row 1, so row = 2  (same as B!)\\n\\nResult:\\nRow 2: A  B\\nRow 1: C  D\\nRow 0:   E\\n```\\n\\nThis naturally compacts! The key insight is that processing in time order (oldest first) and always taking the minimum valid row achieves the compaction automatically.\\n\\n### Phase 2: Column Assignment\\n\\nNow we need to assign x-positions. This is about:\\n1. Keeping the same \\\"branch\\\" in the same column where possible\\n2. Minimizing edge crossings\\n3. Handling merges and forks\\n\\n**Simple approach**: Track \\\"active lanes\\\"\\n\\n```python\\ndef assign_columns(commits, rows):\\n    # Group commits by row\\n    by_row = defaultdict(list)\\n    for c in commits:\\n        by_row[rows[c]].append(c)\\n    \\n    column = {}\\n    next_free_column = 0\\n    commit_to_lane = {}  # Track which lane a commit's line of development is in\\n    \\n    # Process from bottom (oldest) to top (newest)\\n    for row in sorted(by_row.keys()):\\n        commits_in_row = by_row[row]\\n        \\n        for commit in commits_in_row:\\n            # If this commit has a parent whose lane is free, use it\\n            # Otherwise, allocate a new lane\\n            \\n            parent_lanes = [commit_to_lane[p] for p in commit.parents if p in commit_to_lane]\\n            \\n            if parent_lanes:\\n                # Prefer to continue in parent's lane\\n                # If multiple parents (merge), pick one and the others will have edges\\n                chosen_lane = parent_lanes[0]  # Could be smarter here\\n            else:\\n                chosen_lane = next_free_column\\n                next_free_column += 1\\n            \\n            column[commit] = chosen_lane\\n            commit_to_lane[commit] = chosen_lane\\n    \\n    return column\\n```\\n\\nThis is a simplification - real implementations get more sophisticated about lane reuse and minimizing crossings.\\n\\n## Final Algorithm Summary\\n\\n1. **Collect all commits** from the repository\\n2. **Topological sort by time** (oldest first)\\n3. **Assign rows** (y-positions) greedily - each commit gets `max(parent_rows) + 1`\\n4. **Assign columns** (x-positions) by tracking active lanes\\n\\n## Edge Cases\\n\\n### Multiple Roots\\nSome repos have multiple root commits (orphan branches, or multiple initial commits). These are handled naturally - each root gets row 0, and they'll be in different columns.\\n\\n### Octopus Merges\\nA commit with multiple parents - the row must be above ALL parents, so it's `max(all_parent_rows) + 1`.\\n\\n### Very Wide Graphs\\nIf there are many parallel branches, we get many columns. May need horizontal scrolling or collapsing inactive branches.\\n\\n## Implementation Notes\\n\\nFor the actual UI:\\n- Each row has a fixed height\\n- Each column has a fixed width\\n- Draw commits as dots/circles\\n- Draw edges (parent relationships) as lines, potentially with curves for crossings\\n- Color-code by branch if possible\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\\n\"}",

A is newer than B, but row(A) > row(B). This violates time consistency!\\n\\n**But wait** - is this actually a problem? Let me re-examine what we want.\\n\\n## Re-examining the Requirements\\n\\nThe original requirement was:\\n> \\\"Two commits in branch A and B can be side by side, but if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row.\\\"\\n\\nLet me parse this more carefully. I think the intuition is:\\n\\n**Reading the graph top-to-bottom should feel roughly like reading time backwards** (newest to oldest). But we don't want to be *strict* about it because that wastes space.\\n\\nThe question is: when MUST we enforce time ordering, and when can we relax it?\\n\\n### Proposal: Time Ordering Within Ancestor Chains Only\\n\\nMaybe the rule should be:\\n- Within a single line of development (ancestor chain), time must be respected\\n- Between unrelated commits, we allow flexibility\\n\\nBut ancestor chains already respect time by the topological constraint! Parents are always older than children, and they're always in higher-numbered rows.\\n\\nSo actually, **the current algorithm is fine**. The \\\"time consistency\\\" constraint I wrote earlier is too strict.\\n\\n### What About Parallel Branches?\\n\\nThe concern might be visual: if branch A and branch B are side by side, and you're scanning down, you expect to be going back in time. But if commits jump around in time between columns, it's confusing.\\n\\nLet me think about this differently. Consider:\\n\\n```\\n     col0  col1\\nrow0:  A    B\\nrow1:  C    D  \\nrow2:     E\\n```\\n\\nWhere times are: A=T5, B=T4, C=T3, D=T2, E=T1\\n\\nReading column 0: A(T5) \u2192 C(T3) - going back in time \u2713\\nReading column 1: B(T4) \u2192 D(T2) \u2192 E(T1) - going back in time \u2713\\nReading row 0: A(T5), B(T4) - both recent\\nReading row 1: C(T3), D(T2) - both older\\n\\nThis feels right! The rows are roughly \\\"eras\\\" even if not strictly time-ordered.\\n\\n### The Actual Invariant\\n\\nI think what we want is:\\n\\n**Invariant**: Within a row, commits should be \\\"roughly contemporary\\\". More precisely, no commit in row N should be an ancestor of a commit in row M where M > N.\\n\\nThis is exactly the topological constraint, which our algorithm satisfies!\\n\\n## Refined Understanding\\n\\nThe algorithm is:\\n1. Process commits oldest-first\\n2. Each commit goes in row = `max(parent_rows) + 1` (or 0 if root)\\n3. This automatically achieves compaction while maintaining topological order\\n\\nThe \\\"time\\\" aspect is a soft property:\\n- Commits in higher rows (lower numbers) tend to be newer\\n- But there's no strict guarantee between unrelated commits\\n- That's okay! The visual makes sense because each column reads like a timeline\\n\\n## What About the Original Example?\\n\\n> \\\"if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row\\\"\\n\\n```\\nBranch A: A1 (T5), A2 (T3), A3 (T1)  [A1 \u2192 A2 \u2192 A3]\\nBranch B: B1 (T4), B2 (T2)           [B1 \u2192 B2]\\nCommon ancestor: ROOT\\n\\nLet's say A3 and B2 both have ROOT as parent.\\n```\\n\\nProcessing order by time: ROOT, A3, B2, A2, B1, A1\\n\\n- ROOT: row 0\\n- A3 (T1): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n- B2 (T2): parent ROOT, row = 1  \\n- A2 (T3): parent A3, row = 2\\n- B1 (T4): parent B2, row = 2\\n- A1 (T5): parent A2, row = 3\\n\\nResult:\\n```\\nrow3: A1\\nrow2: A2  B1\\nrow1: A3  B2\\nrow0:  ROOT\\n```\\n\\nHmm, but A2 (T3) and B1 (T4) are in the same row, even though A2 is older. Is this bad?\\n\\nI don't think so - they're at the same \\\"depth\\\" from their common ancestor. The visual still makes sense: both are \\\"one step up\\\" from their respective parents.\\n\\nBut wait, the original requirement said \\\"B has to skip a row\\\" in some case. Let me re-read...\\n\\n> \\\"if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row\\\"\\n\\nI think this is saying: if you have:\\n- Branch A at row N with commits A1, A2 where A2 is the parent\\n- Branch B at row N with commit B1\\n- And A1 and A2 are BOTH older than B1\\n\\nThen B1 should be at a higher row (lower number) than A2.\\n\\nLet me construct this:\\n```\\nBranch A: A1 (T2) \u2192 A2 (T1)\\nBranch B: B1 (T4)\\nAll rooted at ROOT (T0)\\n```\\n\\nWait, that can't be right. If A1 \u2192 A2, then A1 is the child and A2 is the parent. So A1 is newer than A2 (typically). Let me use clearer names:\\n\\n```\\nBranch A: A_head (T2) \u2192 A_middle (T1) \u2192 ROOT (T0)\\nBranch B: B_head (T4) \u2192 ROOT (T0)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: ROOT, A_middle, A_head, B_head\\n\\n- ROOT: row 0\\n- A_middle (T1): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n- A_head (T2): parent A_middle, row = 2\\n- B_head (T4): parent ROOT, row = 1\\n\\nResult:\\n```\\nrow2: A_head\\nrow1: A_middle  B_head\\nrow0:    ROOT\\n```\\n\\nHere B_head (T4) is at row 1, same as A_middle (T1), even though B_head is much newer.\\n\\nIs this what the requirement was concerned about? Should B_head be at row 2 instead?\\n\\nThe argument for row 2: \\\"B_head is newer than A_head, so it should be at least as high\\\"\\nThe argument for row 1: \\\"B_head is only one commit from ROOT, so depth-wise it's at level 1\\\"\\n\\nI think **the depth-based approach is correct**. The alternative (strict time ordering) would create gaps:\\n\\n```\\nrow3: \\nrow2: A_head  B_head   <- B_head here due to time, but wastes row3\\nrow1: A_middle\\nrow0:    ROOT\\n```\\n\\nThis wastes vertical space without adding clarity.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe algorithm I proposed is correct:\\n1. Process oldest-first\\n2. Row = max(parent rows) + 1\\n3. This gives topological order with good compaction\\n4. Time is a soft property (tends to increase going up, but not strictly)\\n\\nThe original intuition about \\\"skipping rows\\\" was probably about a different case, or was an over-specification. The depth-based approach produces sensible, compact graphs.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

Each commit's row = `max(parent_rows) + 1` (or 0 if root)\n3. Columns are assigned by tracking \"lanes\" - continue parent's lane if possible, otherwise allocate new\n\n**Key insight:** The y-axis isn't strictly \"time\" - it's **topological depth**. Time is only used for processing order (which affects tie-breaking when multiple commits could go in the same row).\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Parents are always below children (topological constraint satisfied)\n- Parallel branches naturally compact - if two commits have the same depth from their common ancestor, they share a row\n- Each column still reads as a timeline (going down = going back in time within that branch)\n- Rows are roughly \"eras\" but not strictly time-ordered across columns\n\n**The original concern about \"skipping rows\"** was over-specified. Consider:\n```\nBranch A: A_head (T2) \u2192 A_middle (T1) \u2192 ROOT\nBranch B: B_head (T4) \u2192 ROOT\n```\n\nResult:\n```\nrow2: A_head\nrow1: A_middle  B_head\nrow0:    ROOT\n```\n\nB_head is newer than A_head but at a lower row. This is **correct** - B_head is only 1 commit from ROOT, while A_head is 2 commits away. Forcing B_head to row 2 would waste space and not add clarity.\n\n**The invariant we actually want:** No commit in row N is an ancestor of any commit in row M where M > N. This is exactly what topological ordering gives us.\n\nWant me to proceed with implementing this, or do you want to discuss the approach further?"

No.\\n- \u2713 They can share a row.\\n\\nSo valid rows under this rule:\\n- {A, B} \u2713\\n- {B, C} \u2713\\n- {C, D} \u2713\\n- {D, E} - wait, E is T1, D is T2, nothing between, \u2713\\n- {A, B, C}? Is there Z where T5 > time(Z) > T3 and Z \u2209 {A,B,C}? \\n  - Only candidates are D(T2) and E(T1), both < T3. \\n  - \u2713 Valid!\\n\\nHmm, so {A, B, C} could all be in one row? That seems too aggressive - A is the child of C, they shouldn't be in the same row!\\n\\n### Missing Constraint: Topological\\n\\nRight, we still need the topological constraint. Commits in the same row cannot have an ancestor relationship.\\n\\nSo the full rule is:\\n1. **Topological**: No two commits in the same row can have an ancestor-descendant relationship\\n2. **Temporal contiguity**: No commit outside the row falls temporally between any two commits in the row\\n\\n### Let's Re-examine\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E, B\u2192D\u2192E\\n```\\n\\nCan A and B share a row?\\n- Topological: A and B are not ancestors of each other \u2713\\n- Temporal: Nothing between T5 and T4 \u2713\\n- **Result: Yes**\\n\\nCan C and D share a row?\\n- Topological: C and D are not ancestors of each other \u2713\\n- Temporal: Nothing between T3 and T2 \u2713\\n- **Result: Yes**\\n\\nCan A and D share a row?\\n- Topological: A and D are not ancestors of each other \u2713\\n- Temporal: B(T4) and C(T3) are between T5 and T2 \u2717\\n- **Result: No**\\n\\nThat last one is interesting! A(T5) and D(T2) can't share a row even though they're unrelated, because B and C would be \\\"skipped over.\\\"\\n\\n### What Does This Give Us?\\n\\nWith these two constraints, I think the algorithm is:\\n\\n1. Sort commits by time\\n2. Greedily group consecutive (in time) commits into rows, subject to:\\n   - No two commits in a row can be ancestors\\n   - (Temporal contiguity is automatic if we group consecutively)\\n\\nLet me try:\\n\\n```\\nSorted: A(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\n\\nRow 0: Start with A\\n  - Can we add B? A and B not ancestors. \u2713 Add B.\\n  - Can we add C? C is ancestor of A. \u2717 Stop.\\nRow 0 = {A, B}\\n\\nRow 1: Start with C\\n  - Can we add D? C and D not ancestors. \u2713 Add D.\\n  - Can we add E? E is ancestor of both C and D. \u2717 Stop.\\nRow 1 = {C, D}\\n\\nRow 2: Start with E\\n  - Nothing left.\\nRow 2 = {E}\\n\\nResult:\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2:   E\\n```\\n\\nThis matches my earlier algorithm! But now I understand *why* it works.\\n\\n### The Connection\\n\\nThe \\\"process oldest first, row = max(parent_rows) + 1\\\" algorithm produces the same result because:\\n- It naturally groups commits at the same \\\"depth\\\" together\\n- Commits at the same depth from a common ancestor tend to be temporally contiguous\\n- The topological constraint is explicitly enforced\\n\\nBut the \\\"temporal contiguity\\\" view gives us a different intuition: **we're compressing a strict time ordering by merging adjacent time-slices, but only when doing so doesn't skip over any commits.**\\n\\n### A Case Where They Might Differ?\\n\\nLet me try to construct a case where the two approaches give different answers...\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T6), B(T5), C(T4), D(T3), E(T2), F(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E\u2192F, B\u2192D\u2192F (two branches merging at F)\\n```\\n\\n**Greedy consecutive grouping:**\\n- Row 0: A, then B? A and B not ancestors. \u2713 {A, B}\\n- Row 1: C, then D? C and D not ancestors. \u2713 {C, D}\\n- Row 2: E, then F? F is ancestor of E. \u2717 {E}\\n- Row 3: {F}\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2: E\\nrow3:   F\\n```\\n\\n**Depth-based (process oldest first):**\\n- F: row 0\\n- E: parent F at 0, row 1\\n- D: parent F at 0, row 1\\n- C: parent E at 1, row 2\\n- B: parent D at 1, row 2\\n- A: parent C at 2, row 3\\n\\n```\\nrow3: A\\nrow2: C  B\\nrow1: E  D\\nrow0:   F\\n```\\n\\nWait, these are different! The depth-based one puts B at row 2, but the greedy consecutive one puts B at row 0.\\n\\nLet me check if the greedy result violates anything:\\n- Row 0 has A(T6) and B(T5) - temporally adjacent \u2713, not ancestors \u2713\\n- Row 1 has C(T4) and D(T3) - temporally adjacent \u2713, not ancestors \u2713\\n\\nBut visually:\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2: E\\nrow3:   F\\n```\\n\\nThe edge from B to D skips row 1's C! And the edge from A to C is fine. But B\u2192D goes from row 0 to row 1, that's fine actually.\\n\\nHmm wait, let me re-examine. In the greedy approach:\\n- A is at row 0, its parent C is at row 1. Good.\\n- B is at row 0, its parent D is at row 1. Good.\\n- C is at row 1, its parent E is at row 2. Good.\\n- D is at row 1, its parent F is at row 3. **Skips row 2!**\\n\\nIs that a problem? The edge D\u2192F would have to pass through row 2, where E lives. \\n\\nIn the depth-based approach:\\n- Every parent is exactly one row below. No skipping.\\n\\n### The Missing Constraint?\\n\\nI think the temporal contiguity rule isn't quite right, or isn't sufficient. What we really want is:\\n\\n**Every edge goes to an adjacent row** (no skipping rows)\\n\\nThis is equivalent to: **row = max(parent_rows) + 1**, the depth-based rule.\\n\\nThe temporal contiguity idea captures something, but it's not the right formalization. The right formalization is depth-based.\\n\\n### So What Was Your Intuition?\\n\\nI think your intuition about \\\"skipping rows\\\" was actually about **edges**, not about commits in rows:\\n\\n> \\\"if the next two commits in A are both older than the next commit in B, then B has to skip at least one row\\\"\\n\\nRephrased: If B's parent is much older than B (with other commits in between temporally), B can't be placed high up - it has to be placed just one row above its parent, even if that means B ends up \\\"lower\\\" (higher row number) than temporally-older commits from other branches.\\n\\nThis is exactly what the depth-based algorithm does!\\n\\n### Revised Conclusion\\n\\nThe correct formalization is **depth-based**:\\n- Row = max(parent_rows) + 1\\n- This ensures no edges skip rows\\n- Commits at the same depth can share a row\\n- Time is used for processing order (affects column assignment and tie-breaking)\\n\\nThe \\\"temporal contiguity\\\" idea was a good intuition but led to a different (and I think worse) algorithm that allows edges to skip rows.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

Let me summarize where we ended up:\n\n## The Key Insight\n\nYour intuition about \"skipping rows\" was actually about **edges not skipping rows**, not about temporal contiguity of commits within rows.\n\nThe depth-based algorithm naturally enforces this:\n- `row(commit) = max(row(parent) for parent in parents) + 1`\n- This guarantees every edge connects adjacent rows\n- No edge ever \"jumps over\" a row\n\n## Why Temporal Contiguity Fails\n\nThe \"compress consecutive commits\" approach I explored can produce layouts where an edge from row 0 to row 3 passes through rows 1 and 2. That's visually confusing - you'd have a line passing through other commits' rows.\n\nExample where they differ:\n```\nCommits: A(T6), B(T5), C(T4), D(T3), E(T2), F(T1)\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E\u2192F, B\u2192D\u2192F\n\nTemporal contiguity gives:     Depth-based gives:\nrow0: A  B                     row3: A\nrow1: C  D                     row2: C  B\nrow2: E                        row1: E  D\nrow3:   F                      row0:   F\n\nIn temporal version: D\u2192F skips row 2!\nIn depth version: every edge is exactly 1 row.\n```\n\n## Final Algorithm\n\n1. **Row assignment**: Process commits oldest-first, assign `row = max(parent_rows) + 1` (or 0 for roots)\n2. **Column assignment**: Track lanes, continue parent's lane when possible, allocate new lanes for branches\n\nTime only affects processing order, which influences tie-breaking when multiple commits could go in the same row.\n\n---\n\nDoes this match what you were reaching for? The \"no edge skips a row\" property seems like the real invariant you wanted, and the depth-based algorithm is the natural way to achieve it."

Sort commits by time (newest first)\\n2. Greedily assign to rows, grouping consecutive commits if they're not ancestors\\n3. Constraints:\\n   - No two commits in same row can be ancestors\\n   - Commits in a row must be temporally contiguous (no commits outside the row fall between them in time)\\n\\n### Example 1: Simple Fork\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T4), B(T3), C(T2), D(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192D, B\u2192D (fork at D, no merge)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing (newest first): A, B, C, D\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Can we add B? A and B not ancestors \u2713. {A, B}\\n- Can we add C? C is ancestor of A \u2717. Stop row 0.\\n- Row 1: C. Can we add D? D is ancestor of C \u2717. Stop row 1.\\n- Row 2: D.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C\\nrow2:   D\\n```\\n\\nEdges: A\u2192C (0\u21921), B\u2192D (0\u21922), C\u2192D (1\u21922)\\n\\nNote: B\u2192D skips row 1! Is this okay?\\n\\nVisually, B is at T3, C is at T2. B is newer than C but they're on different branches. The edge B\u2192D passes by C's row but doesn't intersect C (different column).\\n\\n### Example 2: Long Branch vs Short Branch\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E (one long branch)\\n         No other branches - this is linear!\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: A, B, C, D, E\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Can we add B? B is ancestor of A \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: B. Can we add C? C is ancestor of B \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: C. Can we add D? D is ancestor of C \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 3: D. Can we add E? E is ancestor of D \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 4: E.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A\\nrow1: B\\nrow2: C\\nrow3: D\\nrow4: E\\n```\\n\\nLinear history = no compression possible. Makes sense!\\n\\n### Example 3: Two Independent Branches\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T6), B(T5), C(T4), D(T3), E(T2), F(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E (branch 1), B\u2192D\u2192F (branch 2)\\n         No common ancestor! (orphan branches)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: A, B, C, D, E, F\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Add B? Not ancestors \u2713. {A, B}\\n- Add C? C is ancestor of A \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: C. Add D? Not ancestors \u2713. {C, D}\\n- Add E? E is ancestor of C \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: E. Add F? Not ancestors \u2713. {E, F}\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2: E  F\\n```\\n\\nPerfect compression! Two parallel timelines, 3 rows instead of 6.\\n\\nEdges: A\u2192C (0\u21921), B\u2192D (0\u21921), C\u2192E (1\u21922), D\u2192F (1\u21922)\\n\\nAll edges span exactly 1 row. \\n\\n### Example 4: The Problematic Case (Uneven Branches)\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T6), B(T5), C(T4), D(T3), E(T2), F(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E\u2192F, B\u2192D\u2192F\\n         (branch 1 has 3 commits before merge, branch 2 has 2)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: A, B, C, D, E, F\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Add B? Not ancestors \u2713. {A, B}\\n- Add C? C is ancestor of A \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: C. Add D? Not ancestors \u2713. {C, D}\\n- Add E? E is ancestor of C \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: E. Add F? F is ancestor of E \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 3: F.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2: E\\nrow3:   F\\n```\\n\\nEdges: A\u2192C (0\u21921), B\u2192D (0\u21921), C\u2192E (1\u21922), D\u2192F (1\u21923), E\u2192F (2\u21923)\\n\\nThe edge D\u2192F skips row 2. D is at row 1, F is at row 3.\\n\\n**Is this actually bad?** Let me think about what this looks like:\\n\\n```\\n     col0  col1\\nrow0:  A    B\\n       |    |\\nrow1:  C    D\\n       |     \\\\\\nrow2:  E      |\\n       |      |\\nrow3:  F <----+\\n```\\n\\nThe line from D to F runs alongside column 0's E\u2192F edge. It's a bit odd but... maybe it's fine? It accurately represents that D was committed at T3 and F at T1, with E(T2) in between.\\n\\n### Example 5: What Depth-Based Would Give for Example 4\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T6), B(T5), C(T4), D(T3), E(T2), F(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192C\u2192E\u2192F, B\u2192D\u2192F\\n```\\n\\nDepth-based (oldest first): F, E, D, C, B, A\\n\\n- F: row 0\\n- E: parent F(0), row 1\\n- D: parent F(0), row 1\\n- C: parent E(1), row 2\\n- B: parent D(1), row 2\\n- A: parent C(2), row 3\\n\\n```\\nrow3: A\\nrow2: C  B\\nrow1: E  D\\nrow0:   F\\n```\\n\\nEdges: All exactly 1 row apart.\\n\\n**But look at the times!**\\n- Row 3: A(T6)\\n- Row 2: C(T4), B(T5)\\n- Row 1: E(T2), D(T3)\\n- Row 0: F(T1)\\n\\nB(T5) is below A(T6) even though B is older. That's expected.\\nBut B(T5) is at the same row as C(T4). B is newer!\\n\\nAnd D(T3) is at the same row as E(T2). D is newer!\\n\\nSo in the depth-based version, reading across a row doesn't give you contemporaneous commits.\\n\\n### Example 6: Why Temporal Might Be Better\\n\\nConsider you're looking at the graph and asking \\\"what was happening around T4?\\\"\\n\\n**Temporal approach (row 1 = {C, D} where C=T4, D=T3):**\\nLooking at row 1, you see C and D, times T4 and T3. Close together!\\n\\n**Depth approach (row 2 = {C, B} where C=T4, B=T5):**\\nLooking at row 2, you see C and B, times T4 and T5. Also close, but B is newer.\\n\\nHmm, both seem reasonable actually.\\n\\n### Example 7: More Extreme Uneven Branches\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T10), B(T9), C(T8), D(T7), E(T6), F(T5), G(T4), H(T3), I(T2), J(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E\u2192F\u2192G\u2192H\u2192I\u2192J (10-commit branch 1)\\n         Plus: X(T5.5) \u2192 J (1-commit branch 2, between F and G in time)\\n         \\nActually let me simplify:\\nCommits: A(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1), X(T4.5)\\nAncestry: A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E (main branch), X\u2192E (short branch)\\n```\\n\\nWait, T4.5 means X is between A(T5) and B(T4). Let me use integers:\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T6), X(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\nAncestry: A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E, X\u2192E\\n```\\n\\n**Temporal approach:**\\nProcessing: A, X, B, C, D, E\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Add X? Not ancestors \u2713. {A, X}\\n- Add B? B is ancestor of A \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: B. Add C? C is ancestor of B \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: C. Add D? D is ancestor of C \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 3: D. Add E? E is ancestor of D \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 4: E.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  X\\nrow1: B\\nrow2: C\\nrow3: D\\nrow4:   E\\n```\\n\\nEdge X\u2192E goes from row 0 to row 4! That's 4 rows of skipping.\\n\\n**Depth approach:**\\nProcessing: E, D, C, B, X, A\\n\\n- E: row 0\\n- D: parent E(0), row 1\\n- C: parent D(1), row 2\\n- B: parent C(2), row 3\\n- X: parent E(0), row 1\\n- A: parent B(3), row 4\\n\\n```\\nrow4: A\\nrow3: B\\nrow2: C\\nrow1: D  X\\nrow0:   E\\n```\\n\\nEdge X\u2192E is just 1 row.\\n\\n### The Tradeoff is Clear Now\\n\\n**Temporal contiguity:**\\n- Rows represent time slices\\n- Reading a row = \\\"what was happening around this time\\\"\\n- But edges can skip many rows if branches have different lengths\\n\\n**Depth-based:**\\n- Rows represent topological depth\\n- All edges span exactly 1 row (clean visual)\\n- But commits in a row may be from very different times\\n\\n### Which is Better?\\n\\nI dismissed temporal too quickly. Let me reconsider.\\n\\nThe skipping edges in temporal are actually *informative*. When X\u2192E skips 4 rows, it's telling you \\\"X was committed way after E, even though X's parent is E.\\\" That's useful information!\\n\\nIn the depth-based version, X and D are on the same row, even though X(T5) is much newer than D(T2). That hides the temporal relationship.\\n\\n**Maybe temporal IS what you want?**\\n\\nThe question is: what's the primary purpose of the graph?\\n\\n1. **Understanding branch structure**: Depth-based is cleaner\\n2. **Understanding when things happened**: Temporal is more accurate\\n\\nFor a git history viewer, I could see arguments both ways...\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

The depth view hides that the feature branch was stale.\\n\\n### Example 9: Interleaved Work\\n\\nTwo developers working in parallel, commits interleaved in time:\\n\\n```\\nT1: ROOT\\nT2: A1 (Alice, parent ROOT)\\nT3: B1 (Bob, parent ROOT)\\nT4: A2 (Alice, parent A1)\\nT5: B2 (Bob, parent B1)\\nT6: A3 (Alice, parent A2)\\n\\nCommits: A3(T6), B2(T5), A2(T4), B1(T3), A1(T2), ROOT(T1)\\nAncestry: A3\u2192A2\u2192A1\u2192ROOT, B2\u2192B1\u2192ROOT\\n```\\n\\n**Temporal approach:**\\nProcessing: A3, B2, A2, B1, A1, ROOT\\n\\n- Row 0: A3. Add B2? Not ancestors \u2713. {A3, B2}\\n- Add A2? A2 is ancestor of A3 \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: A2. Add B1? Not ancestors \u2713. {A2, B1}\\n- Add A1? A1 is ancestor of A2 \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: A1. Add ROOT? ROOT is ancestor \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 3: ROOT.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A3  B2\\nrow1: A2  B1\\nrow2: A1\\nrow3:   ROOT\\n```\\n\\nEdges:\\n- A3\u2192A2: 0\u21921 \u2713\\n- B2\u2192B1: 0\u21921 \u2713\\n- A2\u2192A1: 1\u21922 \u2713\\n- B1\u2192ROOT: 1\u21923 (skips row 2!)\\n- A1\u2192ROOT: 2\u21923 \u2713\\n\\nHmm, B1\u2192ROOT skips a row. That's because A1 was committed between B1 and ROOT.\\n\\n**Depth approach:**\\n- ROOT: row 0\\n- A1: row 1\\n- B1: row 1\\n- A2: row 2\\n- B2: row 2\\n- A3: row 3\\n\\n```\\nrow3: A3\\nrow2: A2  B2\\nrow1: A1  B1\\nrow0:   ROOT\\n```\\n\\nAll edges exactly 1 row. But A2(T4) and B2(T5) are in the same row even though they're different times.\\n\\n### Example 10: What Does \\\"Skipping\\\" Really Mean Visually?\\n\\nLet me think about what it looks like when an edge skips rows.\\n\\n```\\nTemporal Example 9:\\n     col0  col1\\nrow0: A3    B2\\n      |     |\\nrow1: A2    B1\\n      |      \\\\\\nrow2: A1      \\\\\\n      |        \\\\\\nrow3: ROOT <----+\\n```\\n\\nThe B1\u2192ROOT edge runs down from row 1 to row 3, passing by row 2. It doesn't intersect A1 (different column), but it does span multiple rows.\\n\\nIs this bad? I think it's actually **informative**:\\n- It shows that between B1 and ROOT, something else happened (A1)\\n- The visual \\\"length\\\" of the edge corresponds to temporal distance\\n\\nCompare to depth-based:\\n```\\nDepth Example 9:\\n     col0  col1\\nrow3: A3\\n      |\\nrow2: A2    B2\\n      |     |\\nrow1: A1    B1\\n      |    /\\nrow0: ROOT<+\\n```\\n\\nHere B1\u2192ROOT is only 1 row, same as A1\u2192ROOT. You lose the information that A1 was committed between B1 and ROOT.\\n\\n### Example 11: Extreme Case - Very Old Branch Revived\\n\\n```\\nT1: ROOT\\nT2-T100: 99 commits on main (M1...M99)\\nT101: Feature commit F1 with parent ROOT\\n\\nAncestry: M99\u2192M98\u2192...\u2192M1\u2192ROOT, F1\u2192ROOT\\n```\\n\\n**Temporal:**\\nF1 would be at row 0 (newest), and M99 could join it.\\nThen M98 at row 1, etc.\\nThe edge F1\u2192ROOT would span 100 rows!\\n\\nVisually, you'd see a very long line from F1 down to ROOT, showing \\\"this commit's parent is ancient.\\\"\\n\\n**Depth:**\\nF1 would be at row 1 (depth 1 from ROOT), same row as M1.\\nF1(T101) and M1(T2) at the same row! That's a 99-time-unit difference hidden.\\n\\n### The Case FOR Temporal\\n\\n1. **Rows = time slices**: Looking at a row tells you \\\"what was happening around this time\\\"\\n2. **Long edges are meaningful**: They show \\\"this commit was based on something old\\\"\\n3. **Stale branches are visible**: You can see when work was abandoned and resumed\\n4. **Interleaved work is visible**: You see the actual chronology\\n\\n### The Case FOR Depth\\n\\n1. **Clean edges**: Every edge spans exactly 1 row, easier to follow\\n2. **Structural clarity**: Shows the branch/merge structure clearly\\n3. **Compact for unbalanced histories**: A 1-commit branch doesn't create 99 rows of empty space\\n\\n### A Hybrid?\\n\\nWhat if we:\\n1. Use temporal for row assignment\\n2. But allow a maximum edge length (e.g., 5 rows)\\n3. If an edge would be longer, insert \\\"...\\\" or collapse the empty space\\n\\nThis would give temporal benefits while avoiding extreme visual stretching.\\n\\n### Actually, Let's Reconsider the Temporal Algorithm\\n\\nThe greedy algorithm I described might not be optimal. Let me think about what we're actually optimizing.\\n\\n**Goal**: Minimize rows while respecting:\\n1. Topological constraint (no ancestors in same row)\\n2. Temporal contiguity (no gaps)\\n\\nThe greedy approach (scan newest-first, add to current row if possible) might not find the optimal solution.\\n\\nBut actually... I think it does? Because:\\n- We process in time order\\n- We greedily pack\\n- Temporal contiguity is automatically satisfied (we never skip a commit)\\n- Topological constraint is checked\\n\\nLet me verify with a tricky case...\\n\\n```\\nCommits: A(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\nWhat if: A\u2192E, B\u2192D\u2192E, C\u2192E (three branches from E)\\n```\\n\\nProcessing: A, B, C, D, E\\n\\n- Row 0: A. Add B? Not ancestors \u2713. Add C? Not ancestors \u2713. {A, B, C}\\n- Add D? D is ancestor of B \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 1: D. Add E? E is ancestor of D \u2717. Stop.\\n- Row 2: E.\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B  C\\nrow1:    D\\nrow2:      E\\n```\\n\\nEdges: A\u2192E (0\u21922), B\u2192D (0\u21921), C\u2192E (0\u21922), D\u2192E (1\u21922)\\n\\nTwo edges skip row 1: A\u2192E and C\u2192E.\\n\\nIs this the minimum rows? Yes - we can't do better than 3 rows because E must be alone (ancestor of all), and D must be separate from B.\\n\\nCould we arrange it differently? What if we didn't put A, B, C together?\\n\\nRow 0: A, B (not C)\\nRow 1: C, D (C not ancestor of D, D not ancestor of C)\\nRow 2: E\\n\\n```\\nrow0: A  B\\nrow1: C  D\\nrow2:      E\\n```\\n\\nEdges: A\u2192E (0\u21922), B\u2192D (0\u21921), C\u2192E (1\u21922), D\u2192E (1\u21922)\\n\\nOnly one edge skips (A\u2192E). This seems better!\\n\\nSo the greedy algorithm isn't optimal! We got {A,B,C} in row 0, but {A,B} in row 0 and {C,D} in row 1 is better (fewer skipping edges).\\n\\n### Revised Goal\\n\\nMaybe we want to:\\n1. **Primary**: Minimize total rows\\n2. **Secondary**: Minimize total edge-skip distance (sum of |row(child) - row(parent) - 1|)\\n\\nThis is more complex than a simple greedy algorithm...\\n\\n### Is This a Known Problem?\\n\\nThis feels like it might be related to graph drawing algorithms, specifically layered graph drawing (Sugiyama-style). The standard approach there is:\\n\\n1. Assign layers (rows) to minimize edge length\\n2. Order nodes within layers to minimize crossings\\n3. Assign x-coordinates\\n\\nThe layer assignment problem with the goal of minimizing edge lengths is actually NP-hard in general, but there are good heuristics.\\n\\nFor our specific constraints (temporal contiguity + topological), I wonder if there's a polynomial solution...\\n\\n## Summary So Far\\n\\n**Temporal contiguity** is a valid and potentially preferable approach because:\\n- Rows represent time, which is meaningful\\n- Long edges visually show \\\"based on old commit\\\"\\n- You see the actual chronology of development\\n\\n**The tradeoff** vs depth-based:\\n- Depth-based has cleaner edges (all length 1)\\n- Temporal can have long edges spanning many rows\\n- Temporal better shows \\\"when\\\", depth better shows \\\"structure\\\"\\n\\n**Open question**: What's the optimal algorithm for temporal row assignment that minimizes edge skip distance while respecting constraints?\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

No two commits in same row can have ancestor relationship\\n    2. Commits in a row must be temporally contiguous \\n       (no commit outside row falls between them in time)\\n    \\n    Algorithm:\\n    - Process commits newest to oldest\\n    - Greedily add each commit to current row if constraints allow\\n    - When constraint violated, start new row\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    # Sort newest first\\n    sorted_commits = sorted(commits, key=lambda c: -c.time)\\n    \\n    rows = []  # List of sets\\n    current_row = set()\\n    \\n    for commit in sorted_commits:\\n        # Check if commit can join current row\\n        can_join = True\\n        for existing in current_row:\\n            if is_ancestor(commit, existing) or is_ancestor(existing, commit):\\n                can_join = False\\n                break\\n        \\n        if can_join and current_row:\\n            current_row.add(commit)\\n        else:\\n            if current_row:\\n                rows.append(current_row)\\n            current_row = {commit}\\n    \\n    if current_row:\\n        rows.append(current_row)\\n    \\n    # Convert to row assignments\\n    row_of = {}\\n    for i, row in enumerate(rows):\\n        for commit in row:\\n            row_of[commit] = i\\n    \\n    return row_of\\n```\\n\\nWait, I realize this greedy algorithm might group non-contiguous commits. Let me reconsider...\\n\\nActually no - because we process in time order, and we only add to the current row, temporal contiguity is guaranteed. If commit X at T5 and commit Y at T3 are in the same row, it means everything between them (T4) was also considered for this row - it either:\\n1. Was added to this row, or\\n2. Was rejected due to ancestor constraint, so it started a new row\\n\\nSo the constraint \\\"no commit outside the row falls between them\\\" is automatically satisfied by the greedy left-to-right scan.\\n\\n## What About Optimality?\\n\\nThe greedy algorithm minimizes rows but may not minimize total edge skip distance. \\n\\nFrom Example with A\u2192E, B\u2192D\u2192E, C\u2192E:\\n- Greedy gives {A,B,C}, {D}, {E} with skips on A\u2192E and C\u2192E\\n- Alternative {A,B}, {C,D}, {E} has skip only on A\u2192E\\n\\nBut... is the alternative even valid under temporal contiguity?\\n\\nA(T5), B(T4), C(T3), D(T2), E(T1)\\n\\nFor {A,B} at row 0 and {C,D} at row 1:\\n- Row 0: A(T5), B(T4) - contiguous \u2713\\n- Row 1: C(T3), D(T2) - contiguous \u2713\\n\\nYes, valid! So there are multiple valid row assignments, and greedy doesn't find the one with minimum edge skips.\\n\\n**But does it matter?** The difference is whether C is in row 0 or row 1. In both cases:\\n- The A\u2192E edge skips (A is far from E temporally)\\n- The C\u2192E edge skip depends on where C is\\n\\nMaybe minimizing skips isn't the right goal. The greedy algorithm has a nice property: **it keeps contemporaneous commits together**.\\n\\n## Summary: The Temporal Algorithm\\n\\n1. Sort commits by time (newest first)\\n2. Greedily assign to rows: add to current row if no ancestor conflict\\n3. Temporal contiguity is automatic from the greedy scan\\n4. Edges may skip rows - this is **informative**, showing temporal gaps\\n\\nThe result:\\n- Rows = time slices\\n- Long edges = \\\"based on old commit\\\"\\n- Parallel branches are visually parallel when contemporaneous\\n- Stale branches are visually obvious\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nImplement this in Python and see how it looks on real repositories.\"}",

Let me crystallize why:\n\n**The key insight from Example 8 (stale branch):**\n```\nTemporal:\nrow0: F2  M3      <- F2 and M3 are contemporaneous (both recent)\nrow1:     M2\nrow2: F1  M1      <- F1 and M1 are contemporaneous (both old)\nrow3:   ROOT\n\nThe F2\u2192F1 edge skipping row 1 SHOWS you \"this branch was stale\"\n```\n\nvs Depth-based which hides this by putting F2 at the same row as M2.\n\n**The long edges aren't bugs, they're features.** They visually communicate:\n- \"This commit is based on something old\"\n- \"Work happened in between that this branch missed\"\n- \"This branch was stale/dormant\"\n\nThe examples that work especially well:\n- **Example 12 (merge)**: All edges span 1 row - perfect diamond shape\n- **Example 14 (parallel work from same base)**: Beautiful parallel lanes\n- **Example 16 (topic branches)**: All tips in one row, showing contemporaneity\n- **Example 17 (staggered topics)**: C1\u2192ROOT skip shows \"late to the party\"\n\nThe algorithm is simple:\n1. Sort by time (newest first)\n2. Greedily pack into rows, respecting ancestor constraint\n3. Temporal contiguity falls out automatically\n\nDo you want me to proceed with implementing this? Or do you want to poke at any of the examples more?"
